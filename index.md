## Projects

Here is a list of my favourite projects:

1. AtomScan is not available publically. It draws an atom in matplotlib and tkinter to the level of detail required for A Level Chemistry.

2. [greek-and-latin](https://adoria298.github.io/greek-and-latin) provides resources for Ancient Greek and Latin GCSE and A Level.

3. [heis](https://www.github.com/Adoria298/heis) is a multiplayer command line implementation of UNO.

4. [attested-conjectures](https://t18d.github.io/attested-conjectures) is a database of conjectures attested in Greco-Roman papyri that I created and began populating as part of an internship for [Tonk√ºnstler-on-the-Bund](https://t18d.github.io).

4. [lunometer](https://www.github.com/Adoria298/lunometer) converts the UK Government's API-provided JSON into CSV that plots the height of the River Lune.

### Forks

Projects I have worked on or helped:

1. [git-info](https://github.com/dorrabbkhan/git-info) provides stats about Github repository. I collaborated with [dorrabbkhan](https://github.com/dorrabbkhan) to provide this information on a local [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/) server rather than in the command line.

2. [AbUrbeCondita](https://github.com/Adoria298/Ab-Urbe-Condita) converts the current date into Latin in the terminal. I am working on letting this be localised: Latin calculates dates from the foundation of Rome; we want to calculate them from the foundation of the nearest city. My work has yet to be merged into the [main repository](https://github.com/tech189/Ab-Urbe-Condita).
